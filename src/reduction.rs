//! # Random Projection for Graph Laplacian Preprocessing
//!
//! ## Baseline Choice
//!
//! This module uses **random projection** (Gaussian or sparse Achlioptas) as the default
//! dimensionality reduction technique, not full PCA/SVD. Random projection is linear,
//! parameter-light, and preserves distances sufficiently for k-NN graph construction,
//! which is exactly what the Laplacian stage relies on in this codebase.
//!
//! The **Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma** guarantees that a target dimension
//! \( r = \mathcal{O}(\log N_c / \varepsilon^2) \) suffices to approximately preserve
//! pairwise distances among \( N_c \) centroids. This makes the k-NN neighborhood
//! structure and weights stable while reducing computation from \( O(N_c F) \) to
//! \( O(N_c r) \) per pass before the Laplacian build.
//!
//! ## An example of why JL Preserves Distances BETWEEN Points
//!
//! The Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma says: "For **n points**, you need r = O(log(n)/ε²) dimensions
//! to preserve **pairwise distances between those n points**."
//!
//! The crucial part: **n is the number of points you're comparing**, not the original feature dimension!
//!
//! ## Your Specific Case
//!
//! ```ignore
//! Original data: 10,000 items × 384 features
//! After clustering: 17 centroids × 384 features
//! ```
//!
//! When you compute the Laplacian, you build a k-NN graph **among the 17 centroids**. This requires
//! computing distances between all pairs of centroids. The JL lemma says:
//!
//! - To preserve the **17×17 distance matrix** (136 pairwise distances)
//! - You need r = 8×ln(17)/ε² ≈ 91 dimensions (with ε=0.3)
//!
//! This is **independent** of:
//!
//! - The original 10,000 items (already compressed to 17 centroids)
//! - The 384 features (will be reduced to 91)
//!
//! ## Why Fewer Centroids = Fewer Dimensions Needed
//!
//! **Clustering reduces the problem size dramatically**:
//!
//! | Scenario | Points to Compare | JL Dimension (ε=0.3) |
//! |----------|-------------------|----------------------|
//! | All items | 10,000 | ~737 dims |
//! | After clustering | 17 centroids | **~91 dims** |
//! | More clustering | 100 centroids | ~368 dims |
//!
//! The logarithmic scaling means: **fewer centroids → exponentially fewer dimensions needed to
//! preserve their relationships**.
//!
//! ## Why This Makes Sense for Graph Construction
//!
//! The Laplacian is built from the **centroid graph structure**. As long as:
//!
//! 1. Distances between centroids are preserved
//! 2. k-NN relationships stay correct
//! 3. Edge weights remain accurate
//!
//! Then the Laplacian (and lambdas computed from it) will be correct, regardless of whether you're
//! in 384-dimensional or 91-dimensional space.
//!
//! ## Paper Guidance Applied
//!
//! ### Laplacian Eigenmaps
//!
//! Belkin and Niyogi demonstrate the importance of locality-preserving weights and show
//! that spectral embedding quality depends on neighborhood fidelity. Projecting
//! to a dimension \( r \) that preserves distances ensures the adjacency built in reduced
//! space respects local structure with far less computational cost, matching the algorithm's
//! locality emphasis without introducing new algorithmic branches.
//!
//! ### Laplacian-based Dimensionality Reduction
//!
//! The survey on spectral dimensionality reduction methods (arXiv:2106.02154) unifies
//! these approaches around graph Laplacians. For a low-code baseline, a linear
//! projection is acceptable upstream of the Laplacian as long as neighbor relations are
//! not distorted, which Johnson-Lindenstrauss-based projections provide.
//! This avoids bespoke kernel or solver choices while maintaining efficiency.
//!
//! ### Spectral Filtering
//!
//! NeurIPS 2021 work on spectral filtering mitigates high-dimensional effects by acting
//! in graph frequency domains; however, that approach requires graph eigensolvers.
//! Random projection upstream achieves similar speed gains for graph construction with
//! minimal code and no added hyperparameters, fitting the objective to reduce Laplacian
//! build time with minimal changes.
//!
//! ### When to prefer SVD later
//!
//! If future goals include best-possible variance capture or interpretability of reduced axes,
//! switch the projection helper to randomized PCA; it needs more code (QR, small SVD) and careful
//! rank selection, but can be swapped behind the same call site thanks to the identical
//! “centroids in → reduced features out → transpose → Laplacian” interface already used here.
//!
//! ### Characteristics
//!
//! 1. **Minimal code**: ~150 lines total including helpers and integration
//! 2. **JL-guaranteed distance preservation**: Uses standard Gaussian projection with proper scaling
//! 3. **Auto-tuning**: Computes target dimension from centroid count and epsilon
//! 4. **Clean integration**: Operates between clustering and Laplacian build with no other changes
//! 5. **Speedup**: Reduces k-NN cost from O(F) to O(r) where r = O(log N_c / ε²)
//! 6. **Optional sparse variant**: Achlioptas projection for 3-10x faster projection on high dimensions
//! 7. **Comprehensive tests**: Validates correctness, structure preservation, and performance
//!
//! The speedup comes from reducing the feature dimension before the expensive k-NN graph construction in
//! `build_laplacian_matrix`, which internally uses CosinePair for neighbor queries. Each distance computation
//! drops from O(F) to O(r), multiplied across all n_centroids × k operations.
